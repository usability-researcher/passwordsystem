Prefab Models:
All models are already ready for use in practical prefab already generated and ready for you you just place them in the scene.


optimizations:

1-Models Lowpoly saving on quantities of polygons
2-Skeleton:
Using a few bones but that guarantee a realistic movement necessary in order to ease the calculation.
3-Animations
Using short animations, big impact, Savings Calculation.
4-TextureAtlas:
Including homestyle considerable savings calculation.
5-Single Texture:
The PNG images have been greatly compressed with special programs, saving 70x100 volume while maintaining the original quality intact.
6-LOD:
Included LOD mesh for computing performance more fast and efficient:
The package and 'made with the utmost care to ensure optimization and the lowest possible impact on computing performance into play.

Ps important:
it is possible that many models generally understood you present a notice in the console:
ImportFBX Warnings:
Can not import tangents and binormals, Because mesh.
It frequently happens that Unity3D present this message because of particular exports and good to note that this does not mean that the model and compromise.
proceed in this way:
the item Model / Normals and Tangents.
Normals:
